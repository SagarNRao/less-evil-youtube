lG4VkPoG3ko,The medical test paradox: Can redesigning Bayes rule help?,"About Likelihood Ratios, also sometimes called Bayes Factors*.
Viewer-supported: https://3b1b.co/bayes-factor-thanks
Home page: https://www.3blue1brown.com

The book by my friend Matt Cook about paradoxes mentioned at the end:
https://amzn.to/3aBrEzg

On the topic, I can't help also mentioning another paradox book I'm rather fond of by Bunch:
https://amzn.to/3mBDSKE

Another video on Bayes' theorem:
https://youtu.be/HZGCoVF3YvM

*As mentioned in the on-screen note at the end, while the terms ""Bayes Factor"" and ""Likelihood Ratio"" refer to the same ratio in this setting, where Bayes rule is used on the probability of an event with only two possible outcomes (you either have the disease or you don't), they do take on divergent meanings in more general contexts.  Namely, if you have a continuous parameter you are trying to estimate, the two terms reflect two alternate approaches you can use in comparing hypotheses.  In fact, some people take the phrase ""Bayes factor"" to _specifically_ refer to its use in this more continuous context.

If you want more details, Wikipedia actually has a really nice example discussing the difference:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_factor#Example

This post has some nice discussion of the distinction:

Mistakes:
At 1:06:20, when changing r to equal 0.69*i, I said ""this is what we might think of as (2i)^x"", but that is not correct.  It's what we'd think of as [Exp(ln(2)*i)]^x for whatever complex number Exp(ln(2)*i) is.

Beautiful pictorial summary by @ThuyNganVu:
https://twitter.com/ThuyNganVu/status/1259288683489849344

Errors:
At minute 16, the sum should be written with a ""..."" to indicate going to infinity.
At minute 38, the exponent should have 1/(2s^2) instead of 1/s^2 for s to represent standard deviation.
At minute 54, an equal sign was mistakenly used in taking the derivative of x^3 / 3!.
At the end, it should be pointed out that the alternating series with x^n terms only converges for values of x between -1 and 1, so the values one can't be considered proven with values of x outside that range.  Everything with the argument here is fine, as it only deals with the convergent input, but that fact should still be mentioned.

yUrrf3Pm33s,Find a Data Science Project With These 3 Techniques,"In this video I will highlight the 3 techniques that I use to discover projects to work on. 

Many people I talk to struggle to come up with data science projects. To me, identifying problems and digging into them is one of the most important parts of becoming a data scientist to begin with. Finding interesting projects is a skill and is something you can improve on. 

Technique 1 - Focus on the problems that you face. Data science can be used to help solve these and make your life or the lives of people around you easier. I recommend writing 10 project ideas each day to get you used to coming up with them.

Technique 2 - Browse datasets and find one you like. There are tons of repositories of free data online, kaggle, google datasets, etc.. You can just browse these and pursue a dataset that piques your interest.

Technique 3 - Get feedback from and analyze your communities. Most online forums are filled with problems. Use data science to help solve them!

domVw8isGOI,How I Chose My Masters Degree for Breaking into Data Science,"In this video I talk about all of the considerations that went into where I went to school for my masters. I go into how I chose between a masters in computer science and a masters in data science. I also zero in on which schools specifically I applied to, and how I came to my final decision. 

Masters vs certificate vs bootcamp: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9FjwzKFPuM&t=113s&ab_channel=KenJee

I get an avalanche of questions about which masters degree you should do to become a data scientist. People ask me if they should do a masters in data science, statistics, computer science, and the list goes on and on. I also get asked which specific one people should choose. Honestly, I‚Äôve only done one technical masters degree myself, so I don‚Äôt think I can get really granular with the specific school choices. Maybe, just maybe if I get enough input from my peers we will make a collab video with our best advice on how to choose a masters degree, since we will have a couple different perspectives.

Every person has a unique situation, and there are some really good reasons and really bad reasons to do a degree. I don‚Äôt think a masters makes sense for most people. I talk about the benefits and drawbacks of choosing a masters vs a bootcamp vs a certificate in the video linked above. Since I can only speak from my experience, I figure it could help a lot of people if I walked through some of the considerations I made when pursuing my own masters degree. For the record I have masters in global commerce and one in computer science, but I think the commerce degree is out of the scope of this video, so I won‚Äôt really touch on it here.

_0rHU6qAQe0,git for Data Science Made Simple... (Hopefully),"In this video I give a high level overview of git and github for data science. I talk about what git is, why it's important, and I also go through the general workflow of a data science project using git. 

At the most basic level, git is a version control system. It also allows us to work on things simultaneously with our teammates without messing anything up. To be honest, it has revolutionized project management and process control. 

Git lets us track our changes and revert back to previous versions as well.

1. It's not good for beginners (Athlean-X)
2. People are using it to ""hide behind science"" (Athlean-X)
3. It's for p_______  (Greg Doucette and Mark Rippetoe)

How can we get really jacked and strong at the same time? A lot of people seem to think you can‚Äôt, (or you shouldn‚Äôt) because how you should train to get strong is supposedly very different from how you should train to get big. But I don‚Äôt quite agree with this. 

It‚Äôs common to hear that if you want to get strong, you need to lift heavy weights for low reps and if you want to get big, you need to lift light to moderate weights for relatively higher reps. 
Most personal trainers and textbooks outline clear and distinct rep zones for strength, hypertrophy and endurance. For strength: you lift heavy, for size: you lift moderate and for endurance: you lift light. And while there is some truth to this, it doesn‚Äôt capture the full picture.

The bottom line is: unless you‚Äôre going really, ridiculously light, heavy weights (low reps) AND light weights (high reps) are BOTH effective at building muscle. However, when it comes to strength, the rep range really does seem to matter: it is important to lift heavy to maximize top-end strength development. 

In this video I will describe periodization and progression examples for powerbuilding (powerliftng plus bodybuilding) based on these principles.

BjyDaxYpW8o,How HARD Should You Train To Build Muscle? (The Truth),"I think how hard you should workout is one of the most important topics in fitness. If it turns out that pushing it as hard as possible is actually better for muscle growth, then we should just suck it up and do that. But if it turns out that we'd be better off being more moderate with our intensity, so we can balance volume, recovery and other training, then that's what we should do! In this video I'm speaking with 5 different experts about this topic and, while there is some agreement on certain aspects, as you'll see, there is some differing of opinion when it comes to the details.

If you‚Äôve only been in the gym for a year or two, I‚Äôd recommend starting with my fundamentals program instead, which has you training full body 3 days a week instead of 5x/week. https://www.jeffnippard.com/programs/fundamentals

More details on the high frequency program:

This program is designed for intermediate to advanced trainees who are in need of something new to drive continued progress. This is a very unique training style that uses the highest possible frequency of training (hitting every muscle 5 days a week). Full body training has several advantages including:

- Reduced soreness = better performance
- Improved recovery capacity = more progress
- Improved mind-muscle connection per exercise = more focus
- High quality volumes = better muscle growth

Also includes:

- EXACT sets, reps, exercises, rest time, RPE targets
- Exercise substitutions
- Video links for every exercise
- Full summaries of volume for every bodypart
- ‚ÄúProgram Explained‚Äù section
- A full FAQ‚Äôs section

A Disclaimer About EMG Research:

There are various reasons to be skeptical about EMG research. Just because an EMG study shows higher EMG amplitude does not necessarily guarantee that there is greater muscle activation  (although this is most likely assuming the procedure was carried out correctly). In videos, I typically use the phrase ""muscle activation"" as an approximation to shortcut this bit of nuance.

However, greater muscle activation still doesn't guarantee greater hypertrophy over time, as there are situations when muscles can hypertrophy in the absence of activation (such as when being stretched). Still, in my opinion, if all else is equal, there is good reason to think that *some activation* should lead to better muscle growth than *no activation* and that *more activation* should lead to more muscle growth than *less activation*. At this point, there is a big question mark in the literature as to just how much EMG evidence lends credence to long-term muscle hypertrophy. Based on some correlations in the data, I suspect that it is actually more useful than much of the online fitness community seems to think at this moment in time, but skepticism should still be exercised.

In this video, I am *not* using EMG evidence to say ""Exercise X is better than Exercise Y"" but rather to prove the conceptual point that all heads of the delts are active to an appreciable degree in the OHP. Since this finding also makes sense biomechanically (given the combination of shoulder flexion and shoulder abduction present in the OHP) I believe this is a fair corroborative application of this research.

‚Ä£ https://www.jeffnippard.com/programs/full-body-program

If you‚Äôve only been in the gym for a year or two, I‚Äôd recommend starting with my fundamentals program instead, which has you training full body 3 days a week instead of 5x/week. https://www.jeffnippard.com/programs/fundamentals

More details on the high frequency program:

This program is designed for intermediate to advanced trainees who are in need of something new to drive continued progress. This is a very unique training style that uses the highest possible frequency of training (hitting every muscle 5 days a week). Full body training has several advantages including:

- Reduced soreness = better performance
- Improved recovery capacity = more progress
- Improved mind-muscle connection per exercise = more focus
- High quality volumes = better muscle growth

Also includes:

- EXACT sets, reps, exercises, rest time, RPE targets
- Exercise substitutions
- Video links for every exercise
- Full summaries of volume for every bodypart
- ‚ÄúProgram Explained‚Äù section
- A full FAQ‚Äôs section
- 39 scientific references

bLt8BYPkkcQ,Doctor Ranks The MOST Accurate Medical Dramas,"Over the last few years on YouTube I‚Äôve reacted to 16 medical dramas. Today, in honor of counting down the New Year, I decided to rank them from least accurate to most accurate. Remember, just because a show is inaccurate doesn‚Äôt mean it isn‚Äôt an entertaining and fun show, it just means it fails the Doctor Mike realness-test. I also recognize this list is purely subjective, so if you disagree with any of my rankings please let me know in the comments below and let me know where you think these shows actually belong!

The Simpsons is one of the longest-running shows in the history of television, and with characters like Dr. Hibbert and Dr. Nick, they‚Äôve had no shortage of health-related episodes and scenes. Today I dove deep into some of the funniest and most curious medical moments in the history of the Simpsons, such as Homer‚Äôs body fat test, Bart visiting an HMO, and Mr. Burns somehow having every disease known to man. Watch to the end to see what The Simpsons got right, and what they got wrong.

2WoxC4WLT64,Roasted By My 12-Yr Old Nephew While Building A LEGO Hospital,"I played with LEGOs for my entire childhood, and since we‚Äôve been spending so much time indoors this year, I thought it would be fun to grab a new set and build it with my 12-year-old nephew, Ari. Not only did I buy a new set of LEGOs, but a LEGO Hospital, specifically the LEGO 60204 City Hospital for all my fellow blockheads out there. Ari and I had a ton of fun building the helicopter, ambulance, and all of the wild characters. Once we finished we actually improvised a few scenes in ‚ÄúDa Bear Hospital‚Äù just for you. Finally, I delivered my review of how accurate a hospital this is. It‚Äôs got an ice cream shop, so it can‚Äôt be all that bad, right? Any other LEGO sets you think Ari and I should build together? Drop them in the comments below!

IQg1iNrb_KM,Real Doctor & Nurse React to ‚ÄúNurses‚Äù | Medical Drama Review,"NBC must think America loves hospitals, because this year they‚Äôve now bought two medical dramas from Canada! This week, I‚Äôm reacting to ‚ÄúNurses‚Äù, a prime time NBC show about... yep, you guessed it: Nurses. Just because I work in a hospital doesn‚Äôt mean I truly understand the every day hustle of being a nurse though, so I brought on my friend Bianca Antisera, a traveling trauma nurse, to share her insight. There were a lot of puzzling choices in this pilot episode, from unethical blood donations, patient privacy violations, and the bizarre premise that everyone in a hospital is throwing shade all day long. Anything you think we missed?

frc6MjGhh5A,The Harsh Reality Of Being 800 Pounds | Doctor Reacts,"Today I took a look at the story of Casey from TLC‚Äôs ‚ÄúFamily By The Ton‚Äù, a show dedicated to following the journey of a real family‚Äôs weight loss. Honestly, I‚Äôm not a fan of the title of this show, but I decided to press on anyway and see if there was anything valuable to discuss. At his heaviest, Casey weighed 845 pounds and almost never left his father‚Äôs house where he stayed in bed and played video games all day.

For the most accessible exposition of iterated shuffling that I am aware of have a look at the relevant chapter in the book ""Integer partitions"" by Andrews and Eriksson. They also have a nice set of exercises that walk you through proofs for the properties of iterated shuffling that I mention in this video. 

I used Dan Romik's old Mac program ""ASM Simulator"" to produce the movie of the random tilings of growing Aztec diamond boards https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~romik/software/ Sadly this program does not work on modern Macs. 

The arctic heart at the end of the video is a ""chistmasized"" version of an image from the article ""What is a Dimer"" by Richard Kenyon and Andrei Okounkov https://www.ams.org/notices/200503/what-is.pdf Thank you for letting me use this image.

Around the same time that Kasteleyn published the paper I showed in the video, the physicists  Temperley and Fisher published similar results, Dimer problem in statistical mechanics-an exact result, Philosophical Magazine, 6:68, (1961) 1061-1063. The way Kasteleyn as well as Temperley and Fisher calculated the numbers of tilings of  boards with square tiles was a bit more complicated than the nice refinement that I show in the video which is due to Jerome K. Percus, One more technique for the dimer problem. J. Mathematical Phys., 10:1881‚Äì1888, 1969.

This is the paper by Bjorn Poonen and Michael Rubenstein about the 1 2 4 8 16 30 sequence: http://www-math.mit.edu/~poonen/papers/ngon.pdf

The nicest introduction to integer partitions I know of is this book by George E. Andrews and Kimmo Eriksson - Integer Partitions (2004, Cambridge University Press) The generating function free visual proofs in the last two chapters of this vides were inspired by the chapter on the pentagonal number theorem in this book and the set of exercises following it.

Some very nice online write-ups featuring the usual generating function magic:

A timeline of Euler's discovery of all the maths that I touch upon in this video: 
https://imgur.com/a/Ko3mnDi

Check out the translation of one of Euler's papers (about the ""modified"" machine): 
https://tinyurl.com/y5wlmtgb

Euler's paper talks about the ""modified machine"" as does Tanton in the last part of his write-up. 

Another nice insight about the tweaked machine: a positive integer is called ‚Äúperfect‚Äù if all its factors sum except for the largest factor sum to the number (6, 28, 496, ...). This means that we can also use the tweaked machine as a perfect number detector :) 

Today's bug report: 
I got the formula for the number of regions slightly wrong in the video. It needs to be adjusted by +n. In their paper Poonen and Rubenstein count the number of regions that a regular n-gon is divided into by their diagonals. So this formula misses out on the n regions that have a circle segment as one of their boundaries.

The two pieces of music that I've used in this video are 'Tis the season and First time experience by Nate Blaze, both from the free YouTube audio library.

As I said in the video, today's t-shirt is brand new. I put it in the t-shirt shop. Also happy for you to print your own if that works out cheaper for you: https://imgur.com/a/ry6dwJy

V2BybLCmUzs,How did Ramanujan solve the STRAND puzzle?,"Today's video is about making sense of an infinite fraction that pops up in an anecdote about the Indian mathematical genius Srinivasa Ramanujan.

21:19 Chapter 5: Euclidean algorithm
30:15 Chapter 6: The best of the best: 17/12
36:34 Chapter 7: Outramanujing Ramanujan

This was supposed to be a short video but in the end turned out to be quite a tricky to sort out. Anyway, as it sometimes happens, I got carried away and now the video really covers a lot of ground : Pell equations, visualising continued fractions by dissecting rectangles into squares, the relationship between continued fractions and the Euclidean algorithm, the irrationality of root 2. Overall quite a few thing that you won't find anywhere else :)

The way I tell the anecdote in this video is based on the following account by Ramanujan's friend Prasanta Mahalanobis: Current Science, Vol. 9 (3), pp. 74-75.

""On another occasion, I went to his room to have lunch with him. The First World War had started some time ago. I had in my hand a copy of the monthly Strand Magazine which at that time used to publish a number of puzzles to be solved by the readers. Ramanujan was stir¬≠ring something in a pan over the fire for our lunch. I was sitting near the table, turning over the pages of the Strand Magazine. I got interested in a problem involving a rela¬≠tion between two numbers. I have forgotten the details but I remember the type of the problem. Two British offi¬≠cers had been billeted in Paris in two different houses in a long street; the two numbers of these houses were related in a special way; the problem was to find out the two numbers. It was not at all difficult; I got the solution in a few minutes by trial and error. In a joking way, I told Ramanujan, 'Now here is a problem for you'. He said, 'What problem, tell me', and went on stirring the pan. I read out the question from the Strand Magazine. He promptly answered 'Please take down the solution' and dictated a continued fraction. The first term was the solu¬≠tion which I had obtained. Each successive term repre¬≠sented successive solutions for the same type of relation between two numbers, as the number of houses in the street would increase indefinitely. I was amazed and I asked him how he got the solution in a flash. He said, 'Immediately I heard the problem it was clear that the solution should obviously be a continued fraction; I then thought, which continued fraction? And the answer came to my mind. It was just as simple as this.' ""

There is a complete digital archive of The Strand magazine. You can find the page with the puzzle here: https://tinyurl.com/y2lnb8xf (page 790) 

If you read the puzzle in the Strand you'll find that the problem is actually phrased somewhat differently to what Mahalanobis remembers and Mahalanobis also does not spell out the infinite fraction that Ramanujan came up with. And if you do the math(s) some of the other things he says also don't quite sound right. What I am presenting in this video is my best guess for what really happened.

In particular, the continued fraction that I am talking about in video is probably the most natural candidate for Ramanujan's infinite fraction, but others have argued that it could have been a different continued fraction (which I don't buy :) You can find these other infinite fractions here: 'Ramanujan's Continued Fraction for a Puzzle"" by Poo-Sung Park https://tinyurl.com/yyfdscgr and here 'On Ramanujan, continued fractions and an interesting street number' by John Butcher https://tinyurl.com/yy6nv2yg

Solution to the red cross puzzle from Dudeney's book ""Amusements in Mathematics"" p. 168  :) https://imgur.com/a/bBuLOZN

Another interesting way to systematically search for solutions to the Strand puzzle is this: The equation we want to solve is 2 x^2=y^2+y. You can rewrite this as x^2 = y(y+1)/2. The formula on the right is just the formula for 1+2+3+...+y. So just keep adding 1+2+3+... and at every step check whether the number you get is a square ... :)

Other short formulas: 1) Expanding (1+‚àö 2)^n gives a number a+b‚àö2. Then a/b is the nth partial fraction. 2)  Play with powers of the matrix {{2, 1}, {1, 0}}

Here is a solution to the first puzzle (one way to find the general formula):
https://nrich.maths.org/657/solution

The music in this video is by Chris Haugen, Fresh Fallen Snow (playing in the video) and Morning Mandolin (for the credits)

A couple of remarks:
1. Probably the simplest way to deduce the sin and tan parts of the rational trig ratio theorem is to realise that they follow from the cos part via the trigonometric identities: sin(x)=cos(90-x) and tan^2(x) = (1-cos(2x))/(1+cos(2x)). Note that the second identity implies that if tan(x) is rational, then cos(2x) is rational (if tan(x)=c/d, then tan^2(x)=c^2/d^2=C/D and cos(2x)=(D-C)/(D+C)). 

2. Bug report. 
a) Here I redefine cos(120‚ó¶) = 1. 
https://youtu.be/sDfzCIWpS7Q?t=1362
Remarkable :(
b) This transition to the good stuff I clearly did not think through properly.
https://youtu.be/sDfzCIWpS7Q?t=1018
It's possible to make this work for all regular n-gons. There is only one complication that occurs for n's that are of the form 2 * odd. For the corresponding regular n-gons, if you pick up the edges in the order that they appear around the n-gon and assemble them into a star, things close up into (n/2)-stars. For all other n, things work exactly as I showed in the video. Having said that you can also assemble the edges of one of the exceptions into stars. Have a look at this https://imgur.com/68A3fEe and you'll get the idea. Anyway lots more nice side puzzles to be explored here if you are interested  :)

Enjoy!

X63MWZIN3gM,Why did they prove this amazing theorem in 200 different ways? Quadratic Reciprocity MASTERCLASS,"The longest Mathologer video ever, just shy of an hour (eventually it's going to happen :) One video I've been meaning to make for a long, long time. A Mathologerization of the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity. This is another one of my MASTERCLASS videos. The slide show consists of 550 slides and the whole thing took forever to make. Just to give you an idea of the work involved in producing a video like this, preparing the subtitles for this video took me almost 4 hours. Why do anything as crazy as this? Well, just like many other mathematicians I consider the law of quadratic reciprocity as one of the most beautiful and surprising facts about prime numbers. While other mathematicians were inspired to come up with ingenious proofs of this theorem, over 200 different proofs so far and counting, I thought I contribute to it's illustrious history by actually trying me very best of getting one of those crazily complicated proofs within reach of non-mathematicians, to make the unaccessible accessible :) Now let's see how many people are actually prepared to watch a (close to) one hour long math(s) video :)

This video was inspired by Matt Baker's ingenious recasting of of a 1830 proof of the LAW by the Russian mathematician Zolotarev in terms of dealing a deck of cards. Here is Matt's blog post that got me started (written for mathematicians):

https://mattbaker.blog/2013/07/03/quadratic-reciprocity-and-zolotarevs-lemma/

If you want to read up on the properties of the sign of a permutation that I am using in this video, Matt also has a nice write-up of this.

Here is a list of proofs of the law prepared by Franz Lemmermeyer

The first teaching semester at the university where I teach is about to start and all my teaching and lots of other stuff will happen this semester. This means I won't have much time for any more crazily time-consuming projects like this. Galois theory will definitely has to wait until the second half of this year :(  Still, quite a bit of beautiful doable stuff coming up. So stay tuned.

DjI1NICfjOk,Why was this visual proof missed for 400 years? (Fermat's two square theorem),"Today's video is about a new really wonderfully simple and visual proof of Fermat's famous two square theorem: An odd prime can be written as the sum of two integer squares iff it is of the form 4k+1. This proof is a visual incarnation of Zagier's (in)famous one-sentence proof. 

0:00 Intro
2:20 Chapter 1: Discovering a theorem
7:05 Chapter 2: 400 years worth of proofs
9:59 Chapter 3: Zagier's one-sentence proof
15:40 Chapter 4: The windmill trick
22:12 Chapter 5: Windmill maths interlude
25:08 Chapter 6: Uniqueness !!
33:08 Credits

The first ten minutes of the video are an introduction to the theorem and its history. The presentation of the new proof runs from 10:00 to 21:00. Later on I also present a proof that there is only one way to write 4k+1 primes as the sum of two squares of positive integers. 

I learned about the new visual proof from someone who goes by the YouTube name TheOneThreeSeven. What TheOneThreeSeven pointed out to me was a summary of the windmill proof by Moritz Firsching in this mathoverflow discussion: https://mathoverflow.net/questions/31113/zagiers-one-sentence-proof-of-a-theorem-of-fermat
In turn Moritz Firsching mentions that he learned this proof from G√ºnter Zieger and he links to a very nice survey of proofs of Fermat's theorem by Alexander Spivak that also contains the new proof (in Russian): –ö—Ä—ã–ª–∞—Ç—ã–µ –∫–≤–∞–¥—Ä–∞—Ç—ã (Winged squares), Lecture notes for the mathematical circle at Moscow State University, 15th lecture 2007: http://mmmf.msu.ru/lect/spivak/summa_sq.pdf

Enjoy!

P.S.: Added a couple of hours after the video went live: 
One of the things that I find really rewarding about making these videos is all the great feedback here in the comments. Here are a few of the most noteworthy observations so far:
- Based on feedback by one of you it looks like it was the Russian math teacher and math olympiad coach Alexander Spivak discovered the windmill interpretation of Zagier's proof; see also the link in the description of this video.
- Challenge 1 at the very end should (of course :) be: an integer can be written as a difference of two squares if and only if it is odd or a multiple of 4.
-one of you actually ran some primality testing to make sure that that 100 digit number is really a prime. Based on those tests it's looking good that this is indeed the case :)
- one of you actually found this !!! 6513516734600035718300327211250928237178281758494417357560086828416863929270451437126021949850746381 = 16120430216983125661219096041413890639183535175875^2 + 79080013051462081144097259373611263341866969255266^2
- a nice insight about the windmill proof for Pythagoras's theorem is that you can shift the two tilings with respect to each other and you get different dissection proofs this way. Particularly nice ones result when you place the vertices of the large square at the centres of the smaller squares :)
- proving that there is only one straight square cross: observe that the five pieces of the cross can be lined up into a long rectangle with short side is x. Since the area of the rectangle is the prime p, x has to be 1. Very pretty :)
- Mathologer videos covering the ticked beautiful proofs in the math beauty pageant:
e^i pi=-1 : https://youtu.be/-dhHrg-KbJ0 (there are actually a couple of videos in which I talk about this but this is the main one)
infinitely many primes: Mentioned a couple of times: This video has a really fun proof off the beaten track:https://youtu.be/LFwSIdLSosI
pi^2/6: Again mentioned a couple of times but this one here is the main video: https://youtu.be/yPl64xi_ZZA
root 2 is irrational: one of the videos in which I present a proof: https://youtu.be/f1yDExNAEMg
pi is transcendental: https://youtu.be/9gk_8mQuerg
And actually there is one more on the list, Brouwer's fixed-point theorem that is a corollary of of what I do in this video: https://youtu.be/7s-YM-kcKME
- When you start with the 11k windmill and then alternate swapping yz and the footprint construction, you'll start cycling through  different windmill solutions and will eventually reach one of the solutions we are really interested in. Zagier et al talk about this in an article in the American Mathematical Monthly ""New Looks at Old Number Theory"" https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.4169/amer.math.monthly.120.03.243?seq=1",['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge'],27,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DjI1NICfjOk/hqdefault.jpg,"['Fermat', 'Zagier', 'one-sentence proof', 'windmill proof']",0,

(see the Patreon page for details)

Leibniz's formula pi/4 = 1-1/3+1/5-1/7+... is one of the most iconic pi formulas. It is also one of the most surprising when you first encounter it. Why? Well, usually when we see pi we expect a circle close-by. And there is definitely no circle in sight anywhere here, just the odd numbers combining in a magical way into pi. However, if you look hard enough you can discover a huge circle at the core of this formula. 

Here is a link to the relevant chapter in Hilbert and Cohn-Vossen's book Geometry and the Imagination (Google books). I am pretty sure that the idea and proof for the circle proof of the Leibniz formula that I mathologerise in this video first appeared in this book and is due to the authors: https://books.google.com.au/books?id=7WY5AAAAQBAJ&lpg=PA44&pg=PA37#v=onepage&q&f=false

Here is a link to a video in which 3blue1brown about the same hidden circle in Leibniz formula:
https://youtu.be/NaL_Cb42WyY
And another video by him about a hidden circle in the solution to the Basel problem: 
https://youtu.be/d-o3eB9sfls

There is also a neat generalisation to what we talked about in this video to the solution of the Basel problem - in terms of the lattice points in a 4-dimensional sphere and the 4-square counterpart of the 4(good-bad) theorem. If you are interested in some details have a look at the last proof in this write-up by Robin Chapman: https://empslocal.ex.ac.uk/people/staff/rjchapma/etc/zeta2.pdf

=== FAQ ===
Q: Does this use your Non-Euclidean Worlds Engine?
A: No, I'm using Unity for this and it's a totally different effect (no portals)

Q: What systems will this be released for?
A: For sure PC/Linux/Mac on Steam, maybe a console if it becomes popular enough.

Q: Will there be a VR version?
A: Eventually, yes.  But it will likely come as an update.

Q: Is the game free and/or open source?
A: The game is paid, but the engine will be open source so you can make your own Non-Euclidean games.

‚ñ∫ Area of  a spherical triangle: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8VgvoEx7HY

Euler's polyhedron formula is one of the simplest and beautiful theorems in topology. In this video we first derive the formula for the area of a spherical polygon using two theorems proven in the previous two videos which are linked above. This result is then used to prove the fact that V-E+F = 2 is true for all convex polyhedra by projecting the polyhedron on the surface of the sphere and doing some algebraic manipulation.

Summary:
‚ñ∫ A spherical triangle is a surface area of a sphere bounded by 3 arcs of great circles.
‚ñ∫ Any spherical triangle has it's antipodal duplicate

Summary:

The Fermat point of a triangle ABC is a point P such that the sum of distances PA+PB+PC is a minimum.

To find the Fermat point of a triangle ABC:
1. Construct equilateral triangles on each side of ABC
2. Connect vertices A,B and C to the opposite and outermost vertex of equilateral triangle.
3. The point at which the three lines intersect is a Fermat point of triangle ABC.

In the case where one of the angles of triangle ABC is greater than 120 degrees the Fermat point will be located at the obtuse-angled vertex of ABC.

About the video:
   1. Pick any polygon
   2. Split it up into triangles (While it is trivial to triangulate any convex polygon it is has been proven that any polygon, convex or concave, can be decomposed into triangles and there are many triangulation techniques).
   3. Construct a rectangle of equal area for each triangle.
   4. Construct a square of equal area for each rectangle.
   5. Construct a larger square equal to the sum of each smaller squares via Pythagorean Theorem.

________________________________________________________________________________________________
About the video:
Start with a unit circle and then inscribe a regular polygon inside of it. The area of a unit circle is Pi and so the area of the polygon can be calculate to find an approximation for the value of pi. As the number of sides of the polygon is increased the area of the polygon gets closer and closer to the area of the circle. If we can express the area of the polygon in terms of n (number of sides) then the limit as n approaches infinity will evaluate to PI.

Qs0V5ntEWWQ,Explainable AI in Python with LIME (Ft. Diogo Resende),"In this video, Diogo Alves de Resende will be showing us how to use LIME to explain a machine learning model's prediction in Python. LIME or Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations makes it possible to understand black box classifiers which is an exciting field known as Explainable AI.

Local surrogate models are interpretable models that are used to explain individual predictions of black-box machine learning models. Local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) is a paper in which the authors propose a concrete implementation of local surrogate models. Surrogate models are trained to approximate the predictions of the underlying black-box model. Instead of training a global surrogate model, LIME focuses on training local surrogate models to explain individual predictions.

The idea is quite intuitive. First, forget about the training data and imagine you only have the black-box model where you can input data points and get the model's predictions. You can probe the box as often as you want. Your goal is to understand why the machine learning model made a specific prediction. LIME tests what happens to the predictions when you give variations of your data into the machine learning model. LIME generates a new dataset consisting of permuted samples and the corresponding predictions of the black-box model.

NRnaMCNOK7Y,How to Build a Machine Learning Model,"In this video, I will be giving a high-level overview on how to build a machine learning model. I use this cartoon infographic that I've drawn to illustrate the machine learning model building process. I cover the entire process starting from obtaining the initial dataset, data pre-processing, exploratory data analysis, data splitting, model building and prediction performance evaluation (for both classification and regression problems).

This video is based on the blog post that I've written in Towards Data Science on the same topic ""How to Build a Machine Learning Model""

ZSXjj0HW6Kg,Data Science SQL Interview Question Walkthrough (real interview style) | SQL Sundays #8,"Hi friends! Welcome back to SQL Sundays (except this time it's Tuesday)! A weekly SQL data science interview questions and answers walkthrough.

This is another data science SQL interview question and answer done from beginning to end in real interview style.

You may notice that I literally talk through every single thing that I'm doing. This is what interviewers are looking for. This way, the interviewer can clearly understand the approach you're taking and exactly what you're doing. It's crucial because if you do something wrong, the interviewer can actually step in and steer you in the right direction. It's also more conversational and way less awkward than you sitting in silence writing your query. 

This is how I practiced every single mock interview for my own FAANG data science interview. Check out the links below for the entire SQL interview question walkthrough series as well as the video about how I learned SQL from scratch in 11 days to pass my own FAANG data science interview. 

Hope you enjoy the video! ^^

vx-x-yXXE9I,The data science resume that got me my FAANG job (entry level data scientist),"In this video, I go through the resume that got me into FAANG as a data scientist. The resume is the key to getting that interview, which is definitely the hardest part of the entire application process for a data scientist. Our role is super popular but actual positions few and far between. That's why I spent A LOT of time on this resume to get my foot in the door. We're going to go through this line by line and item by item as I go into the details and roast it hard. Sit back and enjoy! :)

It is the core of ‚Äòhypothesis testing‚Äô - an approach in statistics that lets you use data to evaluate your ideas. In fact, this theorem can be applied to a variety of real-life problems. We illustrate it with an interesting example of a business in the fish market area.

The Central Limit Theorem is a theorem in probability theory, whose first version was proposed by the French mathematician Abraham de Moivre in 1733. Moivre published an article where he used a normal distribution to approximate the distribution of the number of heads resulting from many tosses of a fair coin. The finding was nearly forgotten until the French mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace expanded it in his monumental work in the 19th century. Over the years, numerous versions of it have been discovered and proven by other mathematicians. Fascinating, right? Watch the video to learn more!

""Print"", for instance, takes a statement or an object and provides its printed representation in the output cell. It just makes a certain statement visible to the programmer. While ""return"" does not visualize the output. It specifies what a certain function is supposed to give back.

oqnq8miWVq0,Apple's New M1 Chip is a Machine Learning Beast (M1 vs Intel MacBook speed test),"At the start of the year I bought a nearly top spec Intel-based 16-inch MacBook Pro to edit videos and write code. Then Apple released their M1-powered MacBooks and the performance graphs looked insane. I decided to run a few speed test comparisons to compare my MacBook Pro to the new M1 MacBooks.

Read about the experiments and see the results - https://www.mrdbourke.com/m1-macbook-vs-intel-macbook-speed-comparison/

Previously people used techniques such as sliding window object detection, R CNN, Fast R CNN and Faster R CNN. But after its invention in 2015, YOLO has become an industry standard for object detection due to its speed and accuracy. In this video we will understand the theory behind how exactly YOLO algorithm works. In next video we will write code to detect objects using YOLO framework.

c3ejyvgmB5I,"Why I Lived in Detention at Boarding School, More Apology Letters!","Back by popular demand, MORE apology letters from when I was in high school! The 3rd of this series! 

I was sent away to boarding school when I was 15. I was a jerk. I had Neurological disorder that leads to involuntary movements and noises called ‚Äútics,"" but mostly I was just a jerk. At boarding school, if you messed up you received ""time"" which was either served by cleaning the school or sitting in detention. To this day, I hold the record of the most ‚Äútime‚Äù ever earned and thus ever served, in the entire history of the boarding school.  In my case most punishments also involved writing apology notes to whoever I had wronged, be it the headmaster, a fellow student, or a wall. I spent the majority of my evenings and weekends working off time and writing letters of apology. A few years ago....I found the letters.

in this second part I talk about the MagicTile interface, show you how to design and record algorithms as macro moves, as well as talk you through a complete solution of one of the easy Harlequin edge-turning puzzles (featuring the all-time simplest three-piece cycle algorithm as well as some cute parity problems)

on the main Mathologer channel, this video is a hands-on introduction to the 4D Rubik's cube simulator Magic Cube 4D, with a special focus on building macros for solving this 4D puzzle (for all those of you who would like to give solving the 4D Rubik's cube a go.)

You can download my full set of macros that I put together using the simple methods described in both videos from here:
http://www.qedcat.com/misc/burkard_macros4.log
Having said that I'd like to encourage you all to find and program your own macros. After all, the more work you do in this respect by yourself the closer you will be to being able to say that you solved the 4d Rubik's cube ""on your own"". 
I've also included the macros used in Roice Nelson's published solution (http://superliminal.com/cube/solution/solution.htm ) at the end of my macro file. To understand what most of these algorithms do, you will have to study Roice's write-up. Having said that the algorithm labelled 2nd 4-color series is a very nice example of an elegant short algorithm that twists just one of the corners. Well, worth studying in slow motion. Similarly, the 3rd 3-color algorithm is used for twisting edges (without worrying that it also mucks up some corners). 

Enjoy!

Here again is the description for the video on the main Mathologer channel. 
The vast majority of people who tackle the Rubik's cube never succeed in solving it without looking up somebody else's solution. In this video the Mathologer reveals a simple insight that will enable all those of you who can solve the first layer to design your own full solution for the Rubik's cube, as well as for many other highly symmetric twisty puzzles. 
For more details about this really very fundamental idea behind many twisty puzzle solutions have a look at this article by the Mathologer from a couple of years ago http://www.qedcat.com/rubiks_cube/
Googling ""commutator, Rubik's cube"" will also produce links to a lot of very good articles on this topic. 
The Rubik's cube animations in this video were produced using the program CubeTwister by Werner Randelshofer: http://www.randelshofer.ch/cubetwister/

-Song See Fish Noodles (at Lau Pa Sat)
-Carrot Cake at Chomp Chomp Food Centre (not at all what you think it is‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a savory dish of rice flour‚Ä¶get the ‚Äúblack‚Äù version‚Ä¶it has more flavor)
-Golden Mile Claypot Rice 
-Tiong Bahru Meng See (on Chinatown‚Äôs Food Street‚Ä¶get the Roast Duck over noodles)
-328 Katong Laksa (a little spendy for laksa, but very popular, spicy, and delicious)
-Sungei Road Laksa (More local and cheaper, but equally excellent Laksa)
-Samy‚Äôs Curry Restaurant 
-No Signboard Seafood (my favorite chili crab in the city‚Ä¶note: Chili crab can be very expensive‚Ä¶make sure to check the price upfront so you‚Äôre not surprised)
-JB Ah Meng (White Pepper Crab)
-Rider‚Äôs Cafe 
-Lucy‚Äôs BBQ (at Chomp Chomp Food Centre)
-Finally‚Ä¶I also love the Golden Mile Food Centre, and the Adams Road Food Centre

Things to do:
-The Treetop Walk at the MacRitchie Reservoir is very cool
-Take a boat ride in the Marina
-Check out the Marina Barrage‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a very cool roof-top park where people fly their kites

Some of my favorite Mid-range Hotels (not featured in the video) are:
-The Dorsett
-The Amoy
-Wanderlust Hotel
-Novotel Singapore Clarke Quay
(But my best hotel advice is to just search Hotels.come, Expedia, etc to find the best deals for the days you‚Äôre going‚Ä¶read guest reviews and look at guest pictures.
Also‚Ä¶if you can handle tight spaces and don‚Äôt mind a shared bathroom, you can stay at CUBE Capsule Hotel‚Ä¶it‚Äôs actually a pretty cool experience.  And of course‚Ä¶there‚Äôs always AirBnB)","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food']",19,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6fHASeSrH8w/hqdefault.jpg,"['Travel', 'Best things to do in Singapore', 'Top things to do in Singapore', 'Singapore Travel Tips', 'Singapore Tips', 'Singapore Guide', 'Singapore Travel Guide', 'Travel Advice', 'Travel Guide', 'Singapore Food Guide', 'Best things to eat in Singapore', 'Best food in Singapore', 'Best restaurants in Singapore', 'Travel Show', 'Travel Blog', 'Anthony Bourdain', 'Best places to eat in Singapore', 'Foodie', 'Food Porn', 'Funny', 'Travel Host', 'Gardens By the Bay', 'Marina Bay Sands', 'Sentosa', ""Matt's Travel Tips""]",1,

J98QfxBVV8E,Hunted Pt. 2  - Short Film (Thriller),"Thank You for watching Hunted Pt.2!

The second part of Hunted picks up immediately after the first with Alex seeking answers and coming to terms with his new reality.

I apologize if some scenes seemed rushed and aren‚Äôt as good. While editing I spilled water on my laptop and lost some key footage that would‚Äôve made the film better. So majority of the film are secondary shots that I wasn‚Äôt planning on using. I‚Äôm still in the beginning stages of learning filmmaking and I‚Äôm working on getting better and learning more. I‚Äôd appreciate feedback, good or bad so I can continue to get better and know what to look for when creating future projects.

Behind The Scenes/Blooper footage will be coming out soon on this channel so stayed tuned in the coming weeks

Hunted is a three part story and part three requires a BIG cast so if you are interested in acting as a lurker or in another film of mine in the future then contact me: hundoinquiries@gmail.com or Dm @iamchundo

I received the Blackmagic Design Ursa Mini Pro 12K about a week ago! It was purchased and sent from ACS Cameras (https://www.acscamera.com/) and they were nothing but extremely helpful. So far the camera has been extremely impressive. I got to unbox, setup, and show off test footage from this amazing cinema camera in this video. I swapped  out the pl mount for an ef mount, I added the blackmagic design side handgrip, I added a top cheeseplate made by smallrig, I added a  quick release top handle by smallrig, I added a samsung t5 ssd drive caddie by smallrig, and I mounted my Audiotechnica shotgun microphone  to the cheeseplate. Overall it has been a perfect setup. I even just tested out the Ursa Mini Pro 12K at a wedding. As soon as that video is uploaded I'll be sure to attach it here as well!

G5EK4Pxc1Fk,Yolo V5 Snowboarding LIVE,"I like to snowboard and i like to code. Guess it's time to combine these 2 interests into one live video!! I'm going to strap a GoPro to myself as i snowboard to record training data. Then, we're going to use the latest version of the popular YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm to detect other snowboarders automatically. We'll look at the history of Object Detection and algorithms, then come to interesting conclusions about what makes the latest version of YOLO unique. Using the bounding boxes will help me improve my own ability to navigate and analyze different snowboarding techniques effectively. AI tech is amazing, but let's talk less about it and just build it for our own day to day uses. I'm going to ask you 3 questions about Object Detection, so i'm going to need you to start studying from my list of curated learning resources below. 3 Data Wizards will win $50 in BTC each this week, everyone on Earth is eligible, get hype!

It's the only car I've ever really wanted & the only car i would actually read the owner's manual for (i finished all 230+ pages on day 1). We have to hack this into this thing and build a useful machine learning app ourselves :D. Teslas are better thought of as robots than normal cars. They are computers on wheels, and the (unofficial) Tesla API gives us access to lots of streaming data. We're going to build a NodeJS web app that uses reinforcement learning (OpenAI Gym) + the Tesla API (TeslaJS) + real-time climate data (Weather API) to build our own version of real-time predictive temperature control. Think of this as an energy optimization problem. 

This week there will be 3 winners.  I will chose 3 people who answered 3/3 questions correctly to each receive $175 in BTC/ETH/USDC. Everyone on earth is eligible.

KJIJ_tgpwR4,Let's Build Machine Learning...in RUST? LIVE,"Rust is a programming language that has been voted as the 'most loved programming language' in the Stack Overflow Developer survey every year since 2016. So what's the big deal about Rust? Well, it's quite a performant language because of how it uniquely and cleverly deals with memory management + type safety. Rust is being used in critical production applications where those features matter a lot, and more developers are beginning to take notice. In this episode of my weekly gameshow, we're going to build a tiny Rust library that does some basic data pre-processing and build a regression model as well. We'll then benchmark our code vs Python and see if we can see any performance gains. I'll need your help as I code to interactively answer a few math and multiple choice questions. One Data Wizard gets $500 cash and a dedicated freestyle rap at the end. Start studying Rust and let the games begin!

Creative algorithms that leverage concepts like quantum entanglement and superposition are already being studied by various teams to enable new solutions in fields like Chemistry, Finance, Supply Chain, and Energy. In this 1 hour game show, i'm going to attempt to build a quantum classifier that predicts input output pairs using the PennyLane python library. But I'll need your help! I'll ask for your help throughout the stream, and you'll have to interactively answer my questions. Together, let's see if we can build something somewhat useful.

They'll win $500 cash (sent via BTC or ), a freestyle rap performance by me, and early access to my coming game titled Code Royale. If we can get computers to understand and interpret human language as well as we do, then they'll be capable of automating any intellectual task we can conceive of.

j_SgHF8qo1o,Dealing with Unstructured Documents Through the Intelligent Automation Center of Excellence,"If you are like most enterprise automation COE‚Äôs, you have experienced the benefits that technologies such as RPA have delivered and you are ready to take the next step on the automation journey.

Unstructured content makes up over 85% of enterprise content, yet less than 2% is currently leveraged with existing analytics or automation technologies.  Critical processes from the front office to the back office rely on documents, forms, emails and text to drive the business. Traditional approaches of line of business or data science teams attempting to implement new technology to solve these challenges has proven unsuccessful.  

Join Indico and Cognizant as they discuss how building an Intelligent Automation Center of Excellence can act as the intermediary between line of business and IT driving rapid transformation of organizations enabling them to quickly address the challenge of automating processes that rely on the analysis of unstructured content. 

Tackling unstructured content delivers immediate gains in efficiency.  ROI impacts such as an 85% reduction in process cycle time, a 4x increase in process capacity and an 80% reduction in required resources are common.",['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge'],28,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j_SgHF8qo1o/hqdefault.jpg,,0,

06Yxp5qRq5k,A.I. makes Dragonball Anime on its own,"I asked A.I. to make me a DBZ Episode based on the trolley problem. Will Goku sacrifice 1 life to save the lives of 5 others?

How was this made? I used Open AI's GPT-2 AI model via https://talktotransformer.com/ & then paid an animator to best interpret the story the AI Generated. This story is the result of feeding the GPT-2 AI the very first sentence, then I cherry picked the best one that had a resolution, any resolution, to the trolley problem.

Animated by Chey Fergus - http://www.illustrata.co.uk/

Exact Generated Script:
(Human)
Goku & Vegeta see a trolley coming, problem is, if they switch the rail it will kill 1 person instead of five, so they 
(AI)
switch both rail's. Goku is reluctant to do this but, unfortunately for him, he needs to do it or they will only save 4 people instead of 5. She reminds Goku he has to be a hero for everyone, after a brief moment of hesitation Goku reluctantly takes the first person that comes to mind, and the train explodes. She later tells Vegeta she is glad he noticed him just in time. After Super Saiyan Vegeta returns to normal, he believes that this was the result of Goku's training and that now he will be able to save everyone. Vegeta says he did the right thing and that this is an official Kai, therefore he decides to go search for the rest of them.

VoIgIyAKaXo,SNO-Ball Sculpture Design Concept,"For the real thing, see http://georgehart.com/sculpture/SNO-Ball/SNO-Ball.html

This is a sketch of a sculpture design for Queens University.  It is inspired by work at the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO), for which Prof. Art McDonald recently won a Nobel Prize.  He and his team showed that neutrinos generated in the sun can change flavor while traveling to the earth, which is important because it implies that neutrinos have nonzero mass.  Not being a physicist, I don't understand the details, but many aspects of the engineering and the geometry of the experiment have inspired me to create this sculptural design.  

Because neutrinos rarely interact with matter, the detector needed to be huge and well shielded from stray radiation.  In an amazing engineering effort, McDonald's team created a giant sphere of heavy water, held in a 12-meter diameter clear acrylic sphere which sits inside a larger, water-filled geodesic sphere holding the detectors.  This all sits in a clean-room in a mine more than a mile below the surface of the Earth.

I should say first of all that the sculpture is not intended to be representational of anything; it is purely an abstract form intended to be visually engaging and structurally interesting on its own.  But aspects of the design came together metaphorically in my mind over the past couple of months as I have been reading about this neutrino research. 

I see a certain visual symmetry between the start and the end of these solar neutrino's lives.  They are created in the core of the sun.  As an artist, if I wanted to make a quick visual sketch of the process, I would draw a circle for the sun, an inner circle for the core and a radial line indicating a neutrino's outward path.  And to sketch the detector operation, I would again draw a circle in a circle and a radial line indicating a neutrino's inward path.  This geometric parallelism between the two endpoints of the neutrino's existence is fascinating to me.

The sculpture is planned to be generally spherical, about 1.5 meters in diameter, made of thirty identical, planar, laser-cut, wood components, plus six brass rods.  The initial impression is one of dynamic complexity, drawing in onlookers to examine it more deeply and ask questions.  Perhaps the curious viewer making sense of the sculpture goes through a mental process somewhat analogous to a scientist's process of analysis.  Just as symmetry is central to the work of particle physicists, so the different symmetries of the sculpture are foundational in its organization.

While creating this design, I was struck by the fact that both the mass of the sun and the mass of water in the SNO detector are balls of fluids.  So the body of the sculpture conveys a sense of fluidity with its swirling 5-fold vortices.  A mathematician would characterize the sculpture's symmetry as icosahedral, meaning it has the same set of rotational symmetries as the geodesic framework in the neutrino detector.  But the six radial lines of the sculpture show a different symmetry: cubical.  Has something changed flavor?  The lines are ambiguously evocative of either inward or outward motion.  Each passes through two layers of wood, suggestive of a sphere in a sphere.  And they allude vaguely to an armillary sphere, making another connection to the astronomical context of the neutrino research.

I haven't yet decided about the colors except that the inside and outside surfaces of the wood should be two different colors with the inner one brighter.  This improves the lucidity of the design and is metaphoric for concentric spherical regions in both the sun and the detector.  I am still experimenting with different stains to decide what is most suitable.  

Just as the research at SNO was the collaborative effort of a great many people, I plan to assemble the sculpture as a group project on campus.  I will bring the pre-cut components and will lead a group of students, faculty, and staff in connecting them with cable ties.  Assembling the parts is a challenging puzzle requiring logic, persistence, and careful thought, all skills that will be useful for anyone there aiming someday for their own Nobel Prize.",,28,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VoIgIyAKaXo/hqdefault.jpg,,1,

Dp2ZskwkhkA,The Sea Is Blue: A Stop Motion Short Film | Field Day Presents Vincent Peone,"Ever wonder why the sea is blue? This beautiful stop-motion film imagines how the oceans got their color. 
SUBSCRIBE ‚ñ∫‚ñ∫ https://goo.gl/BuQQrm
The 12 Scenes of Christmas ‚ñ∫http://bit.ly/1Mhcyax
Behind the Stop Motion Film ‚ñ∫ http://bit.ly/1NxqSxv
Writer and director Vincent Peone tells the story of a young girl falling overboard at sea and having a magical experience in the ocean‚Äôs depths‚Ä¶ a poignant metaphor for what he thought might be going on in his sister‚Äôs mind while she was in a life-threatening coma.  Peone wrote this intimate and touching film years ago and finally had the means to bring it to life with Field Day. Much of the score was actually recorded underwater, which lends the film‚Äôs incredible and fantastical visuals an entirely unique feeling and tone. 

Field Day is a place to meet and see YouTube‚Äôs most inspired filmmakers, dynamic entertainers, and exciting personalities.  Each week, one of these inspired creators tries something new and creates their own unique, imaginative, dream video. Whether they‚Äôre investigating far-off places, dancing with remote control cars, or stunt flying with Star Fox, you won‚Äôt want to miss these creators #HaveAFieldDay

Welcome to the official YouTube Channel of the Sushi Traveler!

In these upcoming episodes of the Sushi Traveler, sushi connoisseur Mike Takla travels around the world one sushi bar at a time. 

Takla grew up in Southern California where these sushi bars served as the fancy go-to restaurants, hosting family dinners, birthdays and celebrations. In this new series, he will take his respect and appreciation for this Japanese delicacy to explore new locales, seeking out the people, places, customs and cultures behind this eclectic cuisine across the globe.

While dining at these establishments in Southern California, Mike Takla most of all learned one thing: sit across a sushi chef with the right conversation, and as a result the whole experience will take a turn for the best. Sushi Traveler is Mike's search for the world's most interesting sushi, and the chefs who rise to the occasion.

How are your variables stored in memory, and when do they get deleted? This week on the show, David Amos is here, and he has brought another batch of PyCoder's Weekly articles and projects.

Along with the Real Python article on Python memory management, we also talk about another article about creating even and non-even spaced arrays in Python with np.linspace.

We share an article titled ""The Unholy Way of Using Virtual Environments"". This leads to a discussion on how to structure the directories around a virtual environment.

We also cover several other articles and projects from the Python community including, storing a list in an int, why you should use an ORM (Object Relational Manager), unraveling `not` in Python, an open-source Python fuzzer, and Python static website generators.

The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules based on the predictors. Decision trees use criteria such as information gain (IG), entropy, and Gini.

Decision tree is simple to understand and is easy to interpret with the tree-like plot. It only requires little data preparation and it can handle multi-class problems well.

However, it can create over-complex trees that do not generalize the data well (aka. overfitting). You can avoid overfitting by pruning the tree and setting optimal parameters.

wjlNySHpK9w,Grouping Soccer Players with Similar Skillsets in FIFA 20 | Part 2: Hierarchical Clustering,"This is part 2 of the clustering algorithm series.

In this tutorial, I demonstrate how to group FIFA 20 players with similar skillsets using hierarchical clustering algorithms. Hierarchical clusterings' results are summarized in a dendrogram ‚Äì a tree-like plot. I particularly use single linkage, average linkage, centroid linkage, and complete linkage in this tutorial.

In this video, I go under the hood to look at THREE different Shiny apps from the RStudio shiny gallery.   We will look at the UI and server components of these apps to see how it all comes together to produce the actual apps.

If you do not understand everything at first, that is ok.    There is a learning curve to Shiny.   The most important things to understand are the idea that the apps are divided into two distinct components: UI and server, and that the server functions through ‚Äúreactive‚Äù functions.",['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge'],27,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qTrfIGSonME/hqdefault.jpg,"['shiny app', 'shiny tutorial', 'shiny for beginners', 'r shiny', 'rshiny', 'shiny gallery', 'shiny guided example', 'shiny', 'shiny app anatomy', 'anatomy of shiny app', 'r tutorial', 'rshiny tutorial', 'rshiny intro', 'intro to shiny', 'intro to rshiny', 'intro to shiny r', 'r shiny cheat sheet', 'r tutorial for data science', 'shiny for data science', 'r shiny for dummies', 'r shiny for beginners']",0,

In this video I discuss how you can become a data analyst or data scientist without a college degree.   It is more than possible to become a data professional with no degree - however, it will require learning the particular necessary skillsets as well as demonstrating some expertise with those skillsets, somehow.

In this tutorial, we will provide an introduction to R Markdown.   This is an amazing framework for creating fully reproducible reports while leveraging the power of the R programming language.  The beauty of R Markdown is that you can write code, perform analysis, and view output in it.   It can then be rendered into a document that can be shared with your audience of choice.

An excellent resource for R Markdown, for which this tutorial takes partial influence from, is Chapter 27 of the book ""R for Data Science"" by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund.

Additionally, we will be referencing the cheat sheet for R Markdown, which can be located here: https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf

2Ô∏è‚É£ Learn React from the best. This course is taught by Yihua and Andrei, two Senior Developers who have actually worked on massive React projects for some of the top tech companies in the world.

Yihua has worked on some of the biggest e-commerce websites that you have definitely heard of and likely used.

Andrei has worked on enterprise-level React applications for large tech firms in Silicon Valley as well as Toronto. 300,000+ students from around the world have now taken his courses and many are now working at places like Google, Amazon and Tesla üî•.

By having both Andrei and Yihua teach, you get to see different perspectives and learn from two senior developers as if you are working on projects at a company together with them.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Go beyond the React basics.

You'll learn principles that are important beyond just what you learn as a beginner. Using Andrei and Yihua's experiences, you will learn about design patterns, how to architect your app, organize your code, structure your folders, and how to think about performance. Let‚Äôs just say we don‚Äôt shy away from the advanced topics üí™.

4Ô∏è‚É£ This course is not about making you just code along without understanding the principles so that when you are done with the course you don‚Äôt know what to do other than watch another tutorial... No!

This course will push you and challenge you to go from an absolute beginner in React to someone that is in the top 10% of React developers.

5Ô∏è‚É£ You also won't be learning alone. By enrolling today, you‚Äôll also get to join our exclusive live online community classroom to learn alongside thousands of students, alumni, mentors, TAs and Instructors üëã

ir7aWZiAgcM,Tableau Data Analysis Project in Hindi: Sales Insights : 2 - Data Discovery,"In this video we will cover project planning and data discovery aspect of our sales insights data analysis project. Once sales directory of atliQ hardware has decided to invest in data analysis project he will do a meeting with IT director, data analytics team to come up with a plan. They will use AIMS grid to define purpose and success criteria of this project. 

AIMS grid simple explanation:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6118I9HViuQ

Once AIMS grid is defined, next step is data discovery. In this step, data analyst team approaches IT team within an organization who owns software system that keep track of sales records. These records are stored in mysql database. Tableau can be plugged to this database to pull necessary information required for data analysis. I also discuss ETL, OLTP, OLAP and data warehouse concepts. Many times we need separate data warehouse or OLAP system to run our data analytics queries but in our project we will directly use mysql database.

When they sleep, it‚Äôs not a total hibernation. They wake up once in awhile to eat a little bit and go to the bathroom. Then they go back to sleep until the weather is warmer.
I really hope to see all of our chipmunk friends come back happy and healthy in the spring!
During the winter months I am going to publish some exciting unseen stories from earlier in the year.

g9rKt0slZ5M,Tasting The MUMBAI PAV BHAJI At SHIV SAGAR | Iconic Dish That Evolved Out Of Mill Worker Sustenance!,"#pavbhaji #vegetarian #bangalore

popular pav bhaji, vegetarian restaurant, mumbai pav bhaji, shivsagar pav bhaji, pav bhaji making, falooda, rmv 2nd stage, bangalore, bengaluru

A dish that finds its origins in leftover vegetables tossed by street vendors into an inexpensive but tasty mash and served with local bakery bread as cheap sustenance to Bombay‚Äôs mill workers at the turn of the last century, the pav bhaji evolved to its buttery, cheesy, somewhat indulgent avatar courtesy savvy restaurateurs in the seventies and eighties. My memories of a Mumbai pav bhaji go back to Shiv Sagar, Juhu and Vile Parle, a hop and a skip away from college, where I relished many a plate. So when a craving for the Mumbai style pav bhaji hit me one cold evening, I found my way to the Bengaluru outpost of Shiv Sagar, where brothers Ram and Shyam, second generation restaurateurs trained in the Mumbai restaurant, dish up this quintessential Mumbai fast food that is quite close to the real deal. Hope you enjoy this episode.

Pav Bhaji
Served with a generous dollop of butter and a flourish of coriander, the bhaji is the sort of near-runny consistency that you can smother the butter-soaked pav with. The creamy starchiness of the potatoes, crunch of the onions, tang of the tomatoes and the freshness of coriander, intermingle with the punchy flavours of the special masala and the spicy red chilli paste. Ensure that you ask your bread extra roasted to get the perfect Mumbai pav. 
Rs. 120 (usd 1.6)
8.5/10

Special Kesar Falooda
The traditional Mumbai sweet ending to a plate or two of pav bhaji, this slurp worthy dessert is a riot of textures!
Rs. 120 (usd 1.6)

xyoQhpF9cpk,"90-Year SHIVAJI MILITARY HOTEL, Bangalore‚Äôs Most Popular DONNE BIRYANI Opens Dine-In After 8 Months!","#donnebiryani #lunch #bengaluru

popular biryani restaurant, donne biryani, shivaji military hotel, popular biryani, mutton biryani, chicken biryani, mutton dry, chilli chicken, kaal soup, mutton liver, jayanagar, banashankari, bangalore, bengaluru

When Bengaluru emerged from lockdown months ago, Lokesh and Rajiv, the brothers behind Shivaji Military Hotel took a conscious decision to not reopen dine-in until the situation got better. This meant foregoing a substantial chunk of revenues and relying on takeaway business only, but this was something they were prepared to live with, for the safety of their customers and staff. So when they reopened the eatery to customers a couple of weeks ago, we lost no time in getting there to savour their hugely popular donne biryani and also report on the current experience at this 90-year old culinary institution that has a reputation for being jam packed with customers. We arrived to find certain measures in place, even though in precarious danger of being overrun by its patrons. Thankfully though, the taste of the donne biryani hasn't wavered a bit from the time we tasted it last nearly a year ago. Hope you enjoy this episode, stay safe and happy eating!

Kaal Soup
A warming, gently-spiced mutton bone broth, the trotters are cleaned well and cooked to melt-in-the-mouth texture.
Rs. 180 (usd 2.4)
8.5/10

Chicken Donne Biryani
The biryani is served steaming hot and is impressionable in its persistent aroma and spicy, flavourful fervour laced with green chilli heat. We tasted the donne biryani in takeaway mode where it is packed in foil, but it's not quite the same as when it is ladled onto a donne, a container fashioned of leaves. 
Rs. 200 (usd 2.7)
9/10

Mutton Donne Biryani
The biryani has a slightly smokey tone, and the spices imbued with the weight of the fat and the character of the meat, is rounded in its flavour as opposed to the chicken biryani. The meat is juicy and has absorbed the flavour of the masala rather well. This is the textbook donne biryani, served by this revered culinary institution for the last nine decades. 
Rs. 260 (usd 3.5)
10/10

Chilli Chicken
The chicken is moist, bathed in a green chilli gravy, this is certainly not a dish for the faint-hearted. 
Rs. 180 (2.4)
8.5/10

Mutton Pepper Dry
Tender meat braised in a deep roasted masala with plenty of pepper. 
Rs. 230 (usd 3.1)
9/10

Mutton Liver Fry
The liver has a bit of a bite, its deep flavours juxtapose delightfully against the contrasting freshness of coriander and mint in the green masala.
Rs. 160 (usd 2.2)
8.5/10

sf91j_6hqb8,Flavours of East Godavari At KAKINADA SUBBAIAH GARI HOTEL Bangalore | 30-Dish Vegetarian Andhra Meal,"#vegetarian #lunch #subbayyagarihotel

popular andhra restaurant, new restaurant, andhra food, subbayya gari hotel, subbaiah gari hotel kakinada, east godavari, kakinada cuisine, andhra sweets, subbaiah hotel hyderabad, subbaiah hotel, banana leaf meal, special lunch, andhra bhojanam, brookefield, whitefield, bangalore, bengaluru

In the year 1950, Subbayya Gaaru opened a small 10-seater mess in Kakinada in the East Godavari region of Andhra Pradesh to serve honestly-priced food of the land. Legend has it that he would treat each customer as a guest visiting his home and leave no stone unturned in feeding them. Tales of his legendary hospitality and traditional fare soon spread far and wide and this tiny eatery evolved into the legendary Subbaiah Gari chain of restaurants. I visit their newly opened Bengaluru outpost where I explore the kitchen and the making of some special dishes before savouring a lavish 30-item banana leaf meal that is served with dollops of neyi (ghee) and old-fashioned hospitality that can leave you bursting at the seams! I also brush up on some Telugu along the way. ;-)  Hope you enjoy this episode, take care and stay safe. Happy eating! 

Special Vegetarian Meal
If you‚Äôre looking to savour the traditional flavours of the North Godavari region in Andhra Pradesh, look no further than this special 30-dish Andhra Bhojanam. You begin with tantalising sweets like annavaram prasadam, poornam boorelu, junnu, savoury fries like the tamalapaku (betel leaf) bajji, garelu, before moving on to the procession of curries, lentils, tantalising rice preparations like the pullihora (tamarind rice), panasa (raw jackfruit) mukkala biryani and chutneys. The list of dishes served is far too long to be contained within this description, but suffice to say the food prepared by the master cooks who have trained in the original Kakinada Subbayya Gaari Hotel will hold your attention. But then, this is also the sort of meal that you need to savour at leisure, in order to do full justice to the dishes that are served with generous dollops of neyi (ghee) and old-fashioned hospitality.

yg2wpfLOKcQ,This New NORTHWEST KEBAB & CURRYHOUSE Serves Tasty Kebabs And Curries Beyond The Usual North Indian!,"#bangalore #kebabs #curries

new restaurant, restaurant with a cause, inspiring stories, north west frontier cuisine, kebabs, curries, tandoor, sigri, barbeque, vegetarian, non vegetarian, north indian food, koramangala, bengaluru

In the current climate of gloom and doom, Chefs Sanjay Tyagi and Shyam Sundar Bhaskaran, both seasoned culinary professionals with stints in some top Indian kitchens in the country and overseas, have launched a culinary enterprise to not just serve delicious fare but also, more importantly in our opinion, provide livelihoods to chefs and f&b professionals who have lost their jobs at some of the city‚Äôs top hotels. The result is Northwest Kebab & Curryhouse, a breezy casual dining restaurant in Koramangala, that is showcasing an interesting repertoire of dishes from the North West Frontier region. Barely a couple of weeks old, and with not too many customers at present, this is certainly an eatery to pencil into your eating-out plans if you are looking to taste ‚ÄúNorth Indian-style‚Äù of food that goes beyond the ubiquitous palak paneer and butter chicken! Hope you enjoy this episode, take care and stay safe.

Mewe Aur Subz Ki Seekh
A delicately spiced kebab that offers the richness of reduced milk solids, dry fruits and the freshness of vegetables that intermingles with the gentle spice of chillies.
Rs. 289 (usd 3.9)
8/10 

Paneer Parathdar
Marinated paneer, that is soft and creamy to the bite, stuffed with a slightly spicy, tangy paste of sun dried tomatoes. 
Rs. 289 (usd 3.9)
8.5/10 

Teekhi Machli
A dish that is a confluence of the North, in the mustard oil, and the South, toasted curry leaves and tamarind, that go to flavour the masala that the tilapia is tava-fried in. 
Rs. 429 (usd 5.8)
9/10 

Tabak Maaz
Tender lamb that is braised in saffron, spices and milk, and then finished with ghee. At Northwest Kebab & Curry House, the braised meat is then coated in a light batter and fried. The juicy succulence of the fat and the ghee is what one tastes on the palate as the meat peels away from the bone. 
Rs. 439 (usd 6)
9/10

Chicken Behari/ Mutton Behari
A moist and gently flavoured grilled morsel of meat with none of the heavy handed spicing that one would associate with a North Indian Kebab. My vote though goes to the mutton version of this kebab where the tenderiser has imparted a creamy texture to the smokey flavours of the meat.
Rs. 389 (usd 5.3)/ Rs. 439 (usd 6)
8.5/10 / 9.5/10

Bhindi Musallam
Slit and spiced tender ladyfingers that are fried and topped with a rich musallam gravy of almonds and heavy cream, and garnished with beaten silver, rose petals and saffron oil. 
Rs. 289 (usd 3.9)
8/10

Methi Malai Kofta
Paneer and potato dumplings stuffed with prunes and nuts, cooked in a tomato and cream based gravy laced with the slightly bitter edge of fresh fenugreek.  
Rs. 339 (usd 4.6)
8.5/10

Murg Shinwari Karahi
A rustic preparation that one would perhaps encounter on a highway stop in the NorthWest, one tastes the untamed flavours of ginger, green chillies, coriander seeds in this chicken dish that is prepared and served in cast iron karahi
Rs. 429 (usd 5.8)
8.5/10

Nalli Rogan E Nishat
If you are a mutton lover, this is a must-order dish here. The curry bears the lip-smacking goodness of tender meat and bone marrow, the meat the sort that not just slides off the bone but almost melts away when placed in the mouth.
Rs. 499 (usd 6.8)

temple cuisine, sattvic cuisine,  indian food, vegetarian food, krishna temple, iskcon, rajajinagar,  bangalore, bengaluru

Temple food to many isn't about mere nourishment but a blessing from the divine. And when temple fare is presented in a culinary experience that is not only rich in its depth of traditions, but also celebrates diversity to appeal to all humanity, it is elevated to food that truly satisfies the soul. In a first on Gourmet On The Road, I experience the philosophy and flavours of Sattvic cuisine at The Higher Taste, a fine dining restaurant located in the serene environment of ISKCON Temple, Bengaluru. This isn‚Äôt a typical episode, but then the experience too isn't! Hope you enjoy this very special presentation, take care and stay safe.

Please note:
As a mark of respect to this meal that is served in a temple complex, I have chosen to not rate the dishes in this episode. Thank you.

Nuggekai Rasam
The rasam is flavourful and aromatic, you can taste the sweet lilt of fennel, the warmth of pepper and the weight of the lentils and drumstick drumstick pulp. The floating drumstick kernels add to the appeal of this nourishing broth.
Rs. 165 (usd 2.2)

Multani Paneer Tikka
The paneer is stuffed with the richness of cream and nuts, marinated in yoghurt, saffron and cooked in the tandoor. The peppers provide for a pleasing crunch, and the chaat masala cuts through the dairy richness and refreshes the palate. 
Rs. 325 (usd 4.4)

Potato Milagu Fry
Baby potatoes that are tossed in a sprightly spice mix, loaded with pepper, chilli flakes, cumin, crunchy, fried curry leaves and the fresh tang of lime juice. 
Rs. 230 (usd 3.1)

Mango Rasgulla Chaat
Visualise a chatpata paapdi chaat where the paapdi is replaced with soft rasgullas immersed in the sweetness of mango pulp. If you want to begin your meal on a sweet and spicy note, this is the dish to try. 
Rs. 250 (usd 3.4)    

Raja Bhojanam
Paneer, peas and nuts cooked in a rich cashew, cream and ghee laden curry, topped with a touch of saffron, this curry is a touch of indulgence befitting a king! The spicing is mellow, barring the tingling prick of heat when one bites into a peppercorn. The soft, layered warki paratha makes for a comforting companion to the Raja Bhojanam. If you‚Äôd like to add a touch of spice, savour this gravy with the chilli cheese naan, stuffed with mozzarella that bridges to the creamy flavour of the curry, and topped with finely chopped green chillies.
Rs. 285 (usd 3.9)
Warki Paratha - Rs. 80 (usd 1.1)
Chilli Cheese Naan - Rs. 120 (usd 1.6)

Vazhaipoo Murungakai Kozhambu
A ‚Äòcoconutty‚Äô curry with fried banana blossoms and drumstick segments. The drumstick segments are a tad fibrous, the banana blossom, deep-fried, lends a bit of a bite to this dish. The curry is thick, rich in its coconut flavours and does well to smother every grain of the rice.
Rs. 285 (usd 3.9)

Vetrilai Thakkali Satham
An unusual rice preparation that brings together the sharp flavours of betel leaves with tomatoes. Although the paan flavours are quite pronounced on the palate, the pulpy freshness of the fresh tomatoes helps cut the astringency of the former. Rs. 280 (usd 3.8)

Elaneer Payasam
A payasam of tender coconut, coconut milk, thickened milk for sweetening, this payasam makes for a pleasing end to the meal at The Higher Taste.
Rs. 210 (usd 2.9)

Paan Ice Cream
A sweet paan that‚Äôs blended into a homemade ice cream, this is a ‚Äòbeeda‚Äô the customary sweet paan that concludes a festive meal, in a dessert!
Rs.  165 (usd 2.2)

4Pyyau6V1dU,MANI DUM BIRYANI HOSKOTE | The Village-Style Biryani That Began The Early-Morning Biryani Tradition!,"#hoskote #earlymorning #muttonbiryani

After trying his hand at a number of professions, Mani decided to pay heed to his parent‚Äôs advice and set up a tiny vegetarian eatery in a hut in his hometown on the outskirts of Bengaluru. The year was 1992 and his hometown was Hoskote, then a mere highway halt enroute to Madras. Soon Mani began preparing and serving a rustic-style mutton ‚Äòbiryani‚Äô inspired by his amma‚Äôs recipe. His early patrons, workers from nearby factories, truckers and drivers, for whom the biryani was a satisfying early morning meal to help sustain them through the day, having relished Mani‚Äôs biryani not only carried its taste but also news on this biryani shop. Year after year, the throng of customers to Mani‚Äôs eatery grew, and this also spawned the tradition of the early morning Hoskote biryani ritual with other biryani shops opening in its wake. Today Mani Dum Biryani Hoskote caters to hundreds of customers every Tuesday, Friday, and a few thousand on Sundays, but the rustic soul of the biryani remains, be it in the setting or the flavour of the dish, prepared only by Mani‚Äôs sons with a secret spice blend made by his wife. I drove out at dawn one Tuesday to watch the sons, Manjunath, Kiran Kumar and Chandrashekar prepare the biryani that first put Hoskote on the food lovers‚Äô map. 

Mutton Biryani
The only dish made at Mani Dum Biryani, is unique in its aroma that is redolent of an amalgam of spices combined with meat. Each grain of the rice has absorbed the procession of spices that go into the pot and the fat that is rendered from the meat, this is the sort of biryani that leaves behind a spicy impression on the palate. You can taste the heat of green chillies, and the flavour of the secret spice mix that‚Äôs made in Mani‚Äôs home. Some of the meat is laced with fat that melts in the warmth of one‚Äôs mouth, some pieces though can have a bit of a bite. This is a spicy biryani, and the mosaru bhajji, onion and cucumber raitha helps cool things down.

PIsPdbLTHUA,Tasting The Must-Try World Famous Hotel Diana Gadbad & Veg Cutlet In Udupi | A Legacy Of 60 Years!,"#gadbad #dianarestaurant #udupi 

most popular vegetarian restaurant in udupi, hotel diana, vegetable cutlet, gadbad, ice cream, udupi ice cream, udupi hotel diana, gadbad ice cream, udupi, karnataka

When this enterprise conjured up the name Diana in the sixties, it was meant to sell cool drinks and ice cream in Udupi, then a sleepy town in South Canara. But because cool drinks and ice creams weren‚Äôt popular in this sleepy South Canara town those days, the Pai family decided to diversify into snacks. Their first creation, a vegetable cutlet, then a foreign item to the Udupi populace, took nearly five years to curry favour with the locals. Along the way, they also accidentally conjured up an ice cream concoction, the Diana Gadbad. Whilst the early days may have been tough, these 60-year old timeless classics are the most popular items on the menu today. Hope you enjoy this episode, take care and stay safe.

Vegetable Cutlet
A potato and beetroot patty that is flavoured with a seasoning of curry leaves, lentils and spices, this cutlet is a delicious medley of flavours and textures. The accompanying homemade chutney and sauce make for worthy companions to this Diana classic.
Rs. 75 (usd 1)

Diana Gadbad
An accidental invention of this eatery nearly 60 years ago when the restaurant‚Äôs founder, Mohandas Pai, put together a concoction of three ice creams, because he had very little quantity of each, topped with cashew nuts to feed a large group of customers who dropped in unexpectedly for ice cream. And because it was prepared in a ‚Äògadibidi‚Äô (kannada word for ‚Äòhurry‚Äô) it came to be known as the Gadbad. A layered creation with strawberry ice cream, eight types of dry fruits, fresh fruits, a special ‚ÄòHorlicks‚Äô cake, vanilla cake, no two spoonfuls of this delicious dessert are the same.

sri lakshmi venkateshwara coffee bar, slv, slv coffee bar, slv idli vada, south bangalore‚Äôs popular breakfast and tiffin destination, most popular idli and vada, vegetarian, khara bath, kesari bath, tiffin, banashankari bangalore, bengaluru

When it comes to savouring soft idlis and crunchy vadas, all roads in South Bengaluru lead to Sri Lakshmi Venkateshwara Coffee Bar, or SLV as this string of eateries is popularly known. And it is no surprise given the fact that the brothers behind this tiffin house enterprise have over 125 years of combined experience in the making of the idli, vada and khara bath, beginning with extended stints at the iconic Brahmins‚Äô Coffee Bar where they learnt the trade. I met the brothers behind SLV, Srinivas Bhat, Krishna Bhat and Anantha Bhat at their flagship eatery as it completed 35 years last month to find out what makes their offerings so special.

Idli 
The idli is porous and the sort that dissolves in the mouth when steaming hot. The chutney makes for a flavourful accompaniment to permeate through the idli with its ‚Äòflowing‚Äô consistency and spicy fervour. One of the best idlis one can taste in Bengaluru. The butter, to be honest, is an unnecessary but decadently tasty indulgence!
Rs. 28 (usd 0.4) for two idlis; Rs. 10 (usd 0.1) for butter per idli 
10/10

Vada 
The vade here is double fried ensuring a crisp crunchy bite from the first bite to the last, on the inside it is soft and porous, speckled with black pepper, green chillies and curry leaves. 
Rs. 22 (usd 0.3) per vada
9/10

Chowchow Bath 
The khara bath is ‚Äòrunny‚Äô in its texture and quite loaded in its flavour, one can taste the aroma of the spice mix that goes into the preparation here. The kesari bath is lush with ghee, and studded with pineapple flecks and cashew.

polamma‚Äôs mess, popular andhra eatery for working professionals, students, families, vegetarian andhra meal, banana leaf meal, bhojanam, pappu, sambar, rasam, hyderabadi chicken biryani, chicken roast, mutton pepper fry boneless, chicken polamma, fish fry, bangalore, bengaluru

Every city has its celebrated restaurants, these are the ones that everybody knows. And then there are hundreds of tiny eateries that are almost unknown except to those they quietly provide daily sustenance to - office goers, working professionals, students yearning for a taste of home.... However, in the current scenario of work from home, offices and educational institutions being shut, these establishments that once were the lifeline of the communities they served are now finding it difficult to sustain themselves. 

In this episode, I visit one such Bengaluru eatery, Polamma‚Äôs Mess, named so by its owner, Jagadeesh Reddy in memory of his late grandmother who raised him as an orphan in a village near Kalahasti, Andhra Pradesh. I hear his poignant account of how this once bustling eatery is barely getting by, which is rather unfortunate given the simple but delicious Andhra vegetarian bhojanam that Polamma‚Äôs serves in addition to other meaty sides. I hope you will find within your heart the desire to support eateries like Polamma‚Äôs Mess. These need your support today to help keep them on their feet to continue serving the workforce, students, community at large‚Ä¶ when things get back to normal in the future. Take care and stay safe.


Veg Meals
My favourite part of the meal here. Simple but satisfying affair of rice served with a nutritious and creamy ‚Äòthottakoora‚Äô pappu, vegetable for the day, sambar, rasam, yoghurt and the staple condiments of pappula podi, ghee and ghongura chutney. The simplicity of the meal is reminiscent of what you will be served in an Andhra home.
Rs. 100 (usd 1.3)
8/10

Chicken Roast 
The chicken is double cooked, first in a deep-flavoured masala and then roasted in ghee with plenty of curry leaves and spices. Moist inside and with a slight roasted crunch, this is a must-order if you like chicken and prefer it sprightly and spicy.. 
Rs. 150 (usd 2)
9/10

Chicken Polamma
This chicken fry is fortified with the richness of cashew paste and red chilli powder, the sort of preparation that will make you sweat if you aren‚Äôt accustomed to chilli heat.
Rs. 150 (usd 2)
8/10

Vanjaram Fry
The fish is fried in a tasty masala, albeit thin sliced, the sort that you would expect to find in a mess.
Rs. 200 (usd 2.7)
7.5/10

Mutton Pepper Fry Boneless
The meat is soft, but the flavours of the masala had settled a tad; I also found the cornstarch a bit overwhelming, especially since we didn‚Äôt get to it as soon as it arrived on the table.
Rs. 220 (usd 3)
7/10

Chicken Hyderabadi Biryani
The Friday special at Polamma‚Äôs Mess is portioned enough to feed one, or two if you precede it with the Andhra veg bhojanam. There is plenty of masala and the chicken is moist and juicy, made in the kacchi akhni style. A recipe picked up by Jagadeesh during his stint in Hyderabad.
Rs. 150 (usd 2)

About This Video:
I invented method of making pots from wood ash instead of clay. The ash is mixed with water and formed into shape, left to set for 3-7 days and will then be water resistant like normal clay pottery. Unlike conventional clay pottery, no firing is required, the pot will set by itself in the air due to the high lime content of the ash. First the wood must be burned at a high temperature, well ventilated fire. The white ash is then mixed with water, molded into a pot using conventional pottery techniques and will then set due to the calcium oxide in the wood ash turning into calcium carbonate by absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The pot can then optionally be polished with a smooth object such as a shell while it's semi dry to give it a shiny finish. The resultant pot was then put in water for 24 hours without dissolving. It then held water for another 24 hours though some of the water seeped out. It should make a good alternative to clay pottery if there are no sources of clay around. A brick was also made to test it's ability to form bricks. The ash brick also passed the water test after spending 24 hours in the creek without dissolving. 

About Primitive Technology:
Primitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.

About This Video:
I built a kiln from bricks for the purpose of firing bricks. I started by using a brick mold made of fired clay from a previous video and made bricks from clay. The bricks were allowed to dry and were then transported to my hut using a brick carrying harness I made from cane and a piece of wood. They were dry stacked onto the wall of the hut to keep them out of the rain while waiting to be fired. I then constructed a brick kiln using mud as a mortar for adhering the bricks together. The kiln had 2 fireboxes side by side and was of the updraft kiln type. The kiln was open at the front and back so it could be stoked from these areas. This gave a more consistent firing I found then a kiln only with firebox opening at the front. I put 40 un-fired bricks into the kiln and fired them for 2 hours 30 minutes. All the bricks were fired sufficiently. I then tested an un-fired brick and a fired one by putting them in water. The un-fired brick dissolved quickly while the fired one survived completely intact. The test was a success. My only issue is the bricks are a little weak due to the clay they're made of. I'll look at refining clay or finding a better source somewhere in this area.

This video coincides with the release of my new book ""Primitive technology"", which releases exactly 4 years and 6 months since my first video post on this channel. This video compilation, as well as the book, outlines all the skills and achievements I've attained in this time period using research, hard work and trial and error. Writing this book is something I wanted to do even before making videos and launching this channel. I wanted to offer something tangible that benefited those who had the same keen interest in primitive technology as I do. With that, I thank each and every one of you for your continued support throughout the years, and I really hope you enjoy the book. You can pre-order here: http://po.st/PrimTechBook

To amass enough bricks for a large scale firing will take a long time to do. In the previous hut (that burnt down) bricks were stored inside the hut out of the rain to dry before firing. This took up considerable space within the hut. So with this hut, bricks were stored under the eves of the hut forming a temporary wall around the work space. Clay was taken from a pit and carried to the hut site. The clay was mixed with water in a pit. The ceramic brick mold (made of fired clay in a previous video) was soaked in water and wood ash to make it slippery so that the clay would slide out easily. Bricks were then formed on the floor of half the hut. When the bricks had dried enough they were then stacked under the eaves to form a growing wall. I'll continue making clay bricks and when an opportunity rises, I will take them out and fire them, upgrading them from adobe bricks to fired clay bricks. These will in theory be used in a permanent hut constructed from bricks and mortar.

About This Video:
My hut burned down after I left a fire untended in it. I needed a new one quickly. Fortunately I had already cleared a new spot earlier in the wet season for such a purpose. I constructed the new hut from wood and palm thatch. It was 3 x 3m in floor plan and a total of 3m high with 1.5m high side walls. 4 posts were put into the ground and a pyramidal roof was built on top of this. The frame was then thatched with palm fronds (which are less flammable than grass thatch but don't tend to last as long in wet weather). After finishing the hut I collected the possessions from the last hut and moved them into the new one. Yams from the garden were dug up but there weren't many due to the soil being compacted and low in organic matter. A yam was cooked by wrapping it in clay and baking it in the hot coals for 30 minutes. Now I have a larger hut where I can continue to make projects despite the minor set back that has just occurred.

About This Video:
I built a cross draft kiln and fired a pot in it to test ideas about how cross draft kilns operate. A cross draft kiln is one in which the flames travel from the firebox and across a horizontal wear chamber before traveling vertically up a chimney and out of the kiln. Unlike an updraft kiln there is no perforated floor that the pottery sits on. Instead the pot sits on the floor of the wearchamber as the flames pass around it. 
Taking soil from a previous kiln and mixing it into mud, I formed the kiln so it was less than a meter long. It was 25 cm wide and tall inside the tunnel formed by the kiln though a slight curve was added to the tops of the side walls. The walls were covered with sticks and a roof of mud was put in place onto this. A chimney about 25 cm wide and 65 cm in total height was made at the end of the kiln to draw flames through the kiln due to natural draft. 5 grate bars made of clay were installed in the firebox to make combustion more efficient. A side door was cut into the kiln to access the ware chamber (25 x 25 cm).
Clay was taken from the creek bank and mixed with previous crushed pottery as grog. It was formed into a pot with a pouring spout. This was dried and then placed into the kiln. The kiln was fired with the flames acting as planned and the pot was fired in a relatively short 1 hour and 20 minutes. It would have been a shorter firing time had the kiln not still been wet. The pot was tested with water and held it satisfactorily. 
Cross draft kilns are an apparent improvement on updrafts with the reasoning being that more efficiently retain heat as the hot gasses don't immediately exit the kiln leaving the colder gasses inside. Hot spots are less likely to develop giving a more uniform firing of the pottery. Cross draft kilns developed early in Asia, evolving from the practice of excating tunnels into the side of hills to fire pottery. It's unknown whether the European cross drafts were adopted from the east or were the result of the gradual extension of the firing arch outwards from the conventional updrafts. My personal experience is that this type of kiln fires quickly and evenly though I need to experiment more to understand the positive and negative aspects more fully.

About This Video:
I gathered polynesian arrowroot, grated it, extracted and dried the starch and cooked it into gelatinous, pancake shaped food that tasted like rice noodles. Polynesian arrow root is a plant in the same family as yams but with a different growth habit. It has a single, branching leaf and a single tuber below ground. They were brought to Australia about 5000 years ago as one of the ""canoe"" plants carried by Polynesian seafarers and grow wild in the hills near my hut to this day. The tubers are rich in starch but have a bitter compound that needs to be leached out with water to be made edible. This same compound is traditionally a medicine in small quantities for treating a range of illnesses from gastrointestinal upset to snake bite.  I dug up the tubers which took about 3 minutes to do per plant, yielding one golf ball sized tuber each. These were then washed and grated into a pot using a roof tile. The resulting mash was mixed with water and allowed to settle. The white milky water was then scooped into a second pot and the starch was allowed to settle. The water was then poured off and more starch water was tipped in. At this stage the starch was still bitter, so it was mixed with water, allowed to settle and the clear water above was poured off several times removing this bitterness. When it tasted good, the paste was put onto a tile to dry over a fire. Some of it cooked and became small rubbery pieces of starch. The dry flour was stored in a pot. Some of this was then mixed into a paste and cooked on a tile like a pancake. It turned clear when cooked and has a rubbery texture. It tasted just like a rice noodle which is unsurprising considering the ingredients are nearly the same. Starch is the largest carbohydrate in the human diet. Polynesian arrowroot starch contains 346 calories per 100 g (wheat contains 329) and so the discovery of this staple food is fairly significant. It can be stored indefinitely if kept dry and away from weevils or can be stored as live tubers for six months (then they begin to sprout and should be planted). The live tubers bitterness means animals will not eat them which is good for storage. I may cultivate some in a small plot in the hills near where I dug them up. They are numerous in the wild but may produce more if the soil is tilled.

About This Video:
I made some fired clay bricks as an experiment to see if I could make a permanent, waterproof, building material. A brick mold was fashioned from clay and then fired in existing kiln. This was then used to make bricks formed from clay from the creek bank.  These bricks were then stored in the hut I built last episode to dry. Using half the hut I could fit 40 bricks. These, when semi dry, were then stacked around the fire to dry out. A small kiln was then assembled from un-fired bricks and used to fire 4 bricks as an experiment. It was about 50 cm tall and 25 cm square in cross section. The fired clay bricks were water resistant, they didn't dissolve when submerged in water. 
I will use these bricks to make a larger kiln and hopefully larger huts later on. I estimate that a kiln with a 50 cm cube ware chamber could hold 40 bricks without being so cramped the flames can't get through. The good thing about using bricks to make kilns is that they can be constructed quickly without waiting for the layers to dry, they only crack along the joints between bricks while remaining structurally stable, they can be disassembled and built elsewhere or they can be reconfigured/enlarged to make different types of kilns. Repairs are also possible too.

About This Video:
With the wet season at it's peak, a shelter was needed to keep tools and materials dry as well as providing a dry work-space for future projects. So after some procrastination, I decided on a low roof design. A 2.5 m by 2.5 m hut with a ridge 2 m above the ground and side walls 75 cm high. Upright posts were put in at about 60 cm intervals along the 3 walls. The front was left open  as this is more of an open workshop than a dwelling.  Grass was collected from high up in the hill as it will not grow in the darker, lowland forest. Carrying the thatch to the hut was the most labor intensive part taking approximately 36 hours over the course of more than a week.  The walls were then coated in soft, grey mud from a nearby clearing. The floor was coated in the same material. A large amount of rain fell due to a nearby tropical cyclone passing to the north. Despite this there were only a few leaks (mainly on the ridge line) that were subsequently patched with more grass. A fire was then lit with fire-sticks despite the damp conditions. This was done to help dry the mud walls and floor. The end of the video shows the yam mounds behind the hut doing well from of the torrential rain. The shelter will suffice for the remaining two months of rain that is expected to fall.

About This Video:
With the wet season here, it's time to plant this years crop of yams. The previous yam garden, a large basket type enclosure, worked well in discouraging predators from eating the growing tubers. But with time the cane enclosure rots. So I switched to a method of protecting yams by planting the seed yams under a pile of rocks. Early tests prove that this method protects them from being eaten. The rocks are too heavy for scrub turkeys to lift and wild pigs seem not to associate the pile of rocks with food.
So the next step was to make a garden consisting of individual mounds fortified with neat stonework. This was done by building layers of stone circles around the mound while adding soil with each layer. A yam bulb was planted in each mound during this process. A wooden stake was placed in each mound for the yam vine to grow up and horizontal rafters were tied to the top of these stakes to give the vines something to grow across. By the end of the project the yams had started growing with some coiling around the stakes.

_mvcK_UsZDc,A Model to Compare Practice Patterns of DO and MD Surgical Subspecialists,"In the third episode of the JAOA's new podcast series, Behind the Research, Melissa Schmidt (JAOA Director) interviews Harris Ahmed, DO, author of a recent article in which he and his 4 co-authors analyzed the practice locations of 643 ophthalmologists in Michigan, traditionally a hub of osteopathic education and practice, and found a higher proportions DOs practicing in rural communities, suggesting a familiar trend toward osteopathic involvement in underserved areas. Dr. Ahmed discusses these findings in Michigan as a ""case study"" for how traditional differences in practice patterns for DOs and MDs in primary care are also borne out in surgical subspecialties. He also discusses how expansion of graduate medical education (GME) could help strategically redistribute specialists  of all medical education backgrounds into underserved areas.

The article is available at www.jaoa.org.

The authors then followed up with a survey 4-6 weeks after discharge to track the number of pills that had gone unused by these patients, finding that an overall average of 9.1 pills were left. Here, we discussed their motivation for their study and the implications of these results in the context of the opioid epidemic.
